//Expression

-> An expressions is any valid unit that produces a value . It can be used whenever a value is expeected(like inside an assingment or as a function arguments).

Example:

5 + 3             // 8 (produces a value)
"Hello"           // "Hello"
x = 10            // 10 (assignment is an expression that returns a value)
myFunction()      // the return value of the function
true ? 1 : 0      // 1 (ternary expression)

Expressions can be a part of a statement on their own (unless used as an expression statement)

//statement

A stament is an instruction that performs an action. It doesnt necessarily returns a value .

Example:

var x = 10;                // variable declaration statement
if (x > 5) { ... }         // if statement
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }  // for loop (statement)
function greet() { ... }   // function declaration statement

Statements control the flow of a program or define things like functions or variables.

Key Differences
Feature	                               Expression	                           Statement

Produces a value	                    Yes	                             Not necessarily
Can be assigned	                        Yes	                             No
Ends with ;	                            Optional	                     Required (usually)
Controls flow	                        No	                             Yes
Used in conditionals	                Yes (e.g., x > 0)	             No (can't put an if in if(...))


//Expression Statement
An expression used as a statement is called an expression statement.


Example:
x = 5 + 3;  // expression (5 + 3) used in an assignment statement

Summary
Expression -> Evaluates to a value.

Statement -> Performs an action.
